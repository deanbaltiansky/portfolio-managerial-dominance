<div id="problem" class="section level1">
<h1>Problem</h1>
<div
style="display:flex; align-items:flex-start; gap:1.25em; margin:1em 0;">
<div style="flex:1; min-width:0;">
<p>Managers sometimes behave <strong>dominantly</strong> toward
employees, using threats, coercion, or an aggressive tone in an attempt
to exert influence. In many cases, this behavior is not intended to harm
relationships. Rather, it reflects an instrumental choice: dominance is
used because it is believed to be effective.</p>
<p>Yet dominant behavior can carry <strong>relationship costs</strong>,
including reduced trust, liking, and respect. Despite these risks,
managers vary widely in their willingness to use dominance. This raises
a practical question for organizations: <strong>why do some managers
rely on dominant tactics, even when it may lead to strenuous
relationships between them and their employees?</strong></p>
<p>I propose that managers’ <strong>beliefs</strong> about the
relational impact of dominance matter. Many managers who behave
dominantly do <strong>not</strong> discount relationship outcomes and do
<strong>not</strong> intend to cause relational harm. Instead, they
operate under a <strong>belief-based blind spot</strong>: they
underestimate the extent to which dominance harms relationships,
believing it may be effective <em>without</em> being especially costly
to the relationship.</p>
<p>I distinguish between three potential drivers of dominant
behavior:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Influence expectancies</strong>: beliefs about whether
dominance will increase <em>compliance</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Relationship motivations</strong>: the extent to which
managers <em>care</em> about their relationships with employees.</li>
<li><strong>Relationship expectancies</strong>: beliefs about the
<em>relationship impact</em> of dominant behavior.</li>
</ol>
<p>These situation-specific beliefs do not operate in a vacuum. I trace
relationship expectancies back to a broader social mental model:
<strong>competitive worldview</strong>—the belief that the social world
is a constant battle for status and resources. Managers with a
competitive worldview are more likely to view dominance as
<strong>normal, acceptable, and unobjectionable</strong>, and therefore
to expect limited relationship harm. In turn, these expectations
increase the likelihood that they will behave dominantly.</p>

<div id="executive-summary" class="section level1">
<h1>Executive summary</h1>
<p>Managers often use dominant tactics (threats, coercion, aggressive
tone) because they believe it’s effective. In this case study, I show
that dominant behavior is less about wanting to harm relationships—or
even prioritizing compliance at all costs—and more about a belief-based
blind spot: some managers systematically misjudge the relationship cost
of dominance.</p>
<p>Across four studies, I identify a consistent mechanism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competitive worldview (seeing the social world as a constant battle
for status and resources) predicts greater reliance on dominant
leadership strategies.</li>
<li>The key pathway is relationship expectancies: managers high in
competitive worldview expect dominance to carry limited relationship
harm, and those beliefs increase dominant behavior.</li>
<li>This mechanism holds:
<ul>
<li>in a survey with extensive competing predictors controlled (Study
1);</li>
<li>in reactions to real employee descriptions of dominance (Study
2);</li>
<li>in an incentive-compatible manager–employee role-play with real
financial stakes (Study 3);</li>
<li>and in a causal experiment where shifting relationship expectancies
changes dominant behavior (Study 4).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly for practitioners: <strong>relationship expectancies
are a measurable, movable lever</strong>. Interventions can succeed by
<strong>revealing a relational blind spot</strong>, rather than
attempting to reshape motivations, worldviews, or incentive systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="evidence-strategy" class="section level1">
<h1>Evidence strategy</h1>
<p><strong>Finding the unique roles of relationship expectancies and
competitive worldview in predicting dominance</strong></p>
<p>The first challenge is separating beliefs about the
<strong>relationship impact of dominance</strong>, and the broader
<strong>competitive worldview</strong>, from alternative predictors of
dominant behavior. In <strong>Study 1</strong>, I use well-established
measures and multilevel modeling to test whether relationship
expectancies drive dominant strategies at work, whether competitive
worldview informs these beliefs, and whether these effects hold above
and beyond influence expectancies, relationship motivations, and related
mental models.</p>
<p><strong>Grounding the model in real workplace
experiences</strong></p>
<p>A second challenge is whether these patterns hold beyond abstract
self-report measures. In <strong>Study 2</strong>, I ground dominance in
real workplace experience by collecting employee descriptions of actual
managerial dominance and examining how others forecast its relationship
impact and their own willingness to behave dominantly in the same
situations.</p>
<p><strong>Observing dominant behavior under incentives</strong></p>
<p>A third challenge is whether stated intentions reflect how managers
behave when real outcomes are at stake. In <strong>Study 3</strong>, I
observe dominant behavior directly using an incentive-compatible
manager–employee role-play, allowing me to test whether relationship
expectancies predict actual dominance (even at the potential cost of
financial loss) and whether dominant managers <em>underestimate</em>
relationship harm or non-dominant managers <em>overestimate</em> it.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing a causal effect</strong></p>
<p>Finally, correlational evidence cannot fully establish whether
relationship expectancies <em>lead to</em> dominant behavior. In
<strong>Study 4</strong>, I address this by experimentally manipulating
relationship expectancies and measures subsequent dominance choices.</p>

</div>
<div id="procedure" class="section level2">
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>I conducted a survey of <strong>275 full- and part-time
employees</strong> to isolate the beliefs that predict dominant
leadership strategies at work.</p>
<p>The core variables were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competitive worldview:</strong> The belief that the social
world is a constant battle for status and resources.</li>
<li><strong>Dominant leadership strategies:</strong> Self-reported use
of coercive and threatening tactics to gain and maintain influence at
work.</li>
<li><strong>Expected consequences of dominance:</strong> For each
dominant behavior and strategy, participants rated its:
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationship impact:</strong> <em>Extremely negative</em> to
<em>extremely positive</em> impact on relationships with others;</li>
<li><strong>Influence impact:</strong> <em>Extremely negative</em> to
<em>extremely positive</em> impact on influence over others.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This design allowed me to test whether the effect of competitive
worldview on dominance is driven by <em>relationship expectancies</em>
over and above <em>influence expectancies</em>.</p>
<p>To rule out alternative explanations, I measured and statistically
controlled for a comprehensive set of competing predictors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Status zero-sum beliefs:</strong> The belief that for one
person to gain status, others have to lose.</li>
<li><strong>Cooperative primal beliefs:</strong> The belief that people
are inherently cooperative.</li>
<li><strong>Coercive theories of power:</strong> The belief that people
rise to power through coercion and intimidation.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative theories of power:</strong> The belief that
people rise to power through empathy and respect.</li>
<li><strong>Relationship motivations at work:</strong> The extent
someone cares about having good relationships at work.</li>
<li><strong>Demographic factors:</strong> Race, gender, age, income, and
education.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach isolates the unique predictive contribution of
competitive worldview and relationship expectancies to dominant
leadership behavior at work, over and above plausible alternative
explanations.</p>
</div>
<div id="correlations" class="section level2">
<h2>Correlations</h2>
<p>I first examine descriptive correlations among the core variables.
Competitive worldview, relationship expectancies of dominance, and
dominant leadership strategies are strongly correlated (<em>r</em>s =
.51 <em>to</em> .62). These associations establish basic co-variation,
providing <strong>initial support</strong> for the hypothesized
relationships, but they do not indicate which beliefs
<strong>uniquely</strong> drive dominance. The multivariate analyses
below address this.</p>

<h2>Explaining the effect of competitive worldview on dominance</h2>
<p>To isolate the <strong>unique contribution</strong> of competitive
worldview and <strong>identify the pathway</strong> through which it
predicts dominant strategies at work, I conducted a <strong>simultaneous
mediation model</strong> with 10,000 bootstrap samples.</p>
<p>The model includes two competing mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationship expectancies of dominance</strong> and</li>
<li><strong>Influence expectancies of dominance</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I entered them into the model simultaneously, statistically adjusting
for a comprehensive set of alternative explanations, including zero-sum
beliefs, cooperative primal beliefs, relationship motivations, theories
of power, and demographic factors.</p>
<div id="step-1-competitive-worldview-uniquely-predicts-dominance"
class="section level3">
<h3>Step 1: Competitive worldview uniquely predicts dominance</h3>
<p>Controlling for all alternative predictors, <strong>competitive
worldview remains a strong predictor of dominant strategies</strong>
(<em>b</em> = .75, <em>t</em>(254) = 8.85, 95% CI = [0.58, 0.91], p &lt;
.001). This indicates that competitive worldview contributes unique
explanatory signal to dominance, over and above alternative
predictors.</p>
</div>
<div
id="step-2-competitive-worldview-predicts-lower-anticipated-relationship-cost"
class="section level3">
<h3>Step 2: Competitive worldview predicts lower anticipated
relationship cost</h3>
<p>Additionally, controlling for the same mental models and
demographics, <strong>competitive worldview strongly predicts
relationship expectancies of dominance</strong>, such that those with a
competitive competitive worldview anticipate <strong>less relationship
harm</strong> from dominant behavior (<em>b</em> = .60, <em>t</em>(254)
= 8.85, 95% CI = [0.47, 0.73], <em>p</em> &lt; .001).</p>

    <p>
      To test which beliefs explain the link between competitive worldview and dominance,
      I entered <strong>relationship</strong> and <strong>influence</strong> expectancies
      as simultaneous mediators.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Relationship expectancies account for 41.1%</strong> of the total effect</li>
      <li><strong>Influence expectancies account for only 4.8%</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This indicates that dominance is driven primarily by predicted
      <strong>relationship</strong> harm from dominance,
      rather than its predicted impact on <strong>influence</strong>.

TEST OTHER MEDIATION MODELS ↗ </a>
</p>
</div>
<p>Together, these results show that competitive worldview predicts
dominance strategies at work by <strong>informing beliefs about the
relational consequences of dominance</strong>, rather than expectations
of influence. This pattern holds after accounting for a broad set of
alternative mental models and demographics, but also, importantly, the
extent to which one <strong>cares about relationships</strong> at all.
This suggests that relationship expectancies capture a distinct and
consequential belief underlying dominant behavior.</p>
<p>However, Study 1 relies on structured self-report measures and
abstract descriptions of workplace behavior. While this approach is well
suited for isolating predictive signal, it leaves open the question of
whether the same patterns emerge in employees’ descriptions of
real-world managerial dominance.</p>

<h2>Descriptions of dominance</h2>
<p>To evaluate whether the patterns identified in Study 1 generalize
beyond abstract survey measures, Study 2 grounds dominance in employees’
lived workplace experiences. I asked employees to describe a concrete
instance in which their manager behaved dominantly in an effort to exert
influence.</p>
<p>These open-ended descriptions provide a complementary test of the
model by capturing how dominance is experienced, interpreted, and

I work as an Ecommerce Specialist for a Fabric company that is expanding
their virtual presence. As such, I make many nuance and minor decisions
about the visual layout as well as the descriptions and images used for
items/listings. All of these add up to a much bigger picture to increase
sales and revenue. My manager was trying to get me to use hand-made and
uploaded images for each listing, versus finding the manufacturing made
or other second hand made images. This would be far more time consuming
and would hurt our ability to streamline. The manager basically demanded
that I did so, and told me that it was an order, and that they will hire
someone to produce those images and provide them too me. They weren’t
too loud, but they were forceful.

Several years back I was working at a gym. There’s usually 3-4 of us at
the front desk answering calls, signing people up for membership, giving
tours, and answering general questions/concerns people may have. There’s
also generally one person designated to janitorial duty/cleaning at all
times. The janitor duty wasn’t mine, but occasionally we did help with
cleaning tasks. On this day, no different than any other day, I was
briefly chatting with a friend at the gym in sight of the front desk. My
manger at the time realised this and yelled at me to go clean something.
I put an emphasis on yelled because it was definitely not common and
primarily due to that fact was talking to a friend. I said okay and
continued talking to close the convo. After about a min. or two, he
yelled again. So this time, I immediately closed the convo with my
friend, kind of looking at each other with a slight grin realising the

<h2>Reactions to descriptions</h2>
<p>To test whether the model identified in Study 1 generalizes to
<strong>concrete workplace situations</strong>, I recruited a second
sample of 289 participants. Each participant was shown one randomly
selected description of managerial dominance and asked to react to
it.</p>
<p>Specifically, participants reported:</p>
<ul>
<li>The expected impact of the manager’s behavior on the
<strong>manager–employee relationship</strong> (<em>Extremely
negative</em> to <em>Extremely positive</em>);</li>
<li>The expected impact of the manager’s behavior on <strong>employee
compliance with the task</strong> (<em>Not at all</em> to
<em>Completely</em>); and</li>
<li>How likely they would be to <strong>behave dominantly</strong> (like
the manager) if they were in the manager’s position (<em>Not at all
likely</em> to <em>Extremely likely</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Together with a measure of participants’ <strong>competitive
worldview</strong>, these reactions provide a test of the model under
conditions that more closely resemble <strong>how employees encounter
and interpret dominance in practice</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level2">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>For the primary analyses, I conducted <strong>random-effects
models</strong> with scenario treated as a random effect. This approach
holds constant residual differences between descriptions and focuses
inference on <strong>within-scenario variation</strong> in how people
interpret and respond to the same dominant behavior.</p>
<p>Competitive worldview significantly predicted participants’
willingness to behave dominantly in the described situation (<span
class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}\)</span> = 0.18, 95% CI = [0.05,
0.31], <em>p</em> = .008).</p>
<p>In addition, participants with a more competitive worldview were more
likely to perceive the manager’s dominant behavior as having a positive
relationship impact, rather than relational harm (<span
class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}\)</span> = 0.32, 95% CI = [0.18,
0.45], <em>p</em> &lt; .001).</p>

  <div style="flex:0.3; min-width:260px;">

    <p>
      To directly compare the two competing explanations, I conducted a bootstrapped random-effects mediation model, clustered by scenario, with relationship expectancies and compliance expectancies entered as simultaneous mediators.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>81.6% of the total effect was explained by relationship expectancies</strong> (beta = 0.11, 95% CI = [0.05, 0.17], p = .001)</li>
      <li>By contrast, compliance expectancies <strong>did not explain</strong> a meaningful portion of the effect (beta = −0.01, 95% CI = [−0.03, 0.02], p = .579)</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

</div>

<p>This provides further evidence, with descriptions of real-world
managerial dominance, that the effect of competitive worldview on
behavioral intentions of dominance is primarily explained by
<strong>relationship, rather than compliance, expectancies</strong>.</p>
<p>Together, Study 2 demonstrates that the patterns identified in
abstract survey measures extend to <strong>reactions to real managerial
behavior</strong> from the employee’s perspective. When people encounter
<strong>concrete instances of dominance</strong>, competitive worldview
predicts both a greater willingness to behave dominantly and a
systematic tendency to view dominant behavior as less relationally
harmful. Again, the expected impact on <strong>relationships</strong>
explains the intent to behave dominantly over and above the expected
impact on <strong>compliance</strong>.</p>
<p>At the same time, Study 2 relies on stated reactions to described
situations and hypothetical behavioral intentions. While this approach
strengthens external validity by grounding the model in lived
experience, it does not resolve whether these beliefs translate into
<strong>actual behavior when material outcomes are at
stake</strong>.</p>

<h2>Experimental design</h2>
<p>The study was conducted in two linked phases, with separate samples
of participants acting as managers and employees in a mid-sized
firm.</p>
<p><img src="assets/s3-procedure.png" style="width:100%; height:auto;"></p>
<div id="phase-1-participants-in-the-manager-role"
class="section level3">
<h3>Phase 1: Participants in the manager role</h3>
<p>In Phase 1, 296 participants were assigned to play the role of a
manager in a mid-sized company. Managers were told they needed to assign
a difficult but effort-based task to an employee (another participant
recruited in a later phase). The purpose of the task was to measure
effort, rather than skill: That way, I isolated compliance with the
manager’s request, holding employee ability constant.</p>
<p>Crucially, the incentive structure created a real tradeoff:</p>
<ul>
<li>The manager could earn up to $2 in bonus pay, determined solely by
the employee’s task performance.</li>
<li>The employee also had a $2 pending bonus, but that bonus was
determined entirely by the manager’s decision.</li>
<li>The two bonuses were independent: how much the manager awarded the
employee did not affect the manager’s own bonus.</li>
</ul>
<p>After learning about the task and incentive structure, managers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewed two possible messages they could send to the employee:
<ul>
<li>a dominant message (containing an explicit threat tied to bonus
loss), or</li>
<li>a non-dominant message (neutral, instructional, no threat).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Predicted how each message would affect:
<ul>
<li>employee performance (compliance), and</li>
<li>employee attitude towards the manager (relationship).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chose which message to send.</li>
<li>Indicated whether they believed the employee would later recommend
them as a “good manager.”</li>
<li>Pre-committed how much bonus they would award the employee at every
possible performance level.</li>
<li>Completed a measure of competitive worldview.</li>
</ul>
<p>This phase captures whether managers expect dominance to be effective
and whether they choose it when incentives are real.</p>
</div>
<div id="phase-2-participants-in-the-employee-role"
class="section level3">
<h3>Phase 2: Participants in the employee role</h3>
<p>In Phase 2, a separate sample of 299 participants was assigned to
play the role of employees. Employees were told they had been randomly
matched with a manager from a previous phase.</p>
<p>After reviewing the same task and incentive structure, employees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the message their manager had chosen to send (dominant or
non-dominant).</li>
<li>Decided whether they wanted to engage in the task or opt out.</li>
<li>If they opted in, completed as much as they want of a five-round
task.</li>
<li>Reported their attitudes toward the manager and whether they would
recommend the manager for a paid “good manager” follow-up study.</li>
<li>Learned how much bonus the manager chose to award them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This phase captures a “ground truth” of compliance (task completion)
and relationship impact (attitudes and recommendation as “good
manager”), against which to compare manager predictions. Ultimately,
this allows me to assess the direction of managers’ potential
mis-estimation of relationship impact of dominance.</p>

  <!-- LEFT: Text (40%) -->
  <div style="flex:0.4; min-width:320px;">

    <p>
      The purpose of the task was to measure <strong>compliance</strong>. Accordingly, it was designed
      to be effort-based rather than skill-based, and to allow participants to opt out or disengage
      (e.g., by randomly guessing) at any point.
    </p>

    <p>
      The task was framed as an image-categorization job intended to generate training data for an
      AI image classifier.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Each round included 20 shapes and a simple rule (e.g., “select shapes with six sides”).</li>
      <li>10 shapes matched the rule; 10 did not.</li>
      <li>Correct selections earned 1 point; incorrect selections deducted 1 point.</li>
      <li>Final scores ranged from 0 to 50 points.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Each point earned by the employee translated directly into money for the manager (4 cents per point),
      creating a direct incentive for managers to motivate effort.

class="section level2">
<h2>Replicating the model under material incentives</h2>
<p>The primary analyses focus on participants in the <strong>manager
role</strong> (N = 296). Of these, 84 managers ended up sending the
dominant message and 212 sent the non-dominant message.</p>
<p>Consistent with Studies 1 and 2, a logistic regression shows that
managers’ competitive worldview positively informed their decision to
send the dominant message, controlling for demographics (<em>b</em> =
.51, <em>t</em>(280) = 3.22, 95% CI = [0.20, 0.83], <em>p</em> = .001).
Substantively, each one-point increase on the 7-point competitive
worldview scale is associated with a <strong>67% increase in the odds of
selecting the dominant message</strong>.</p>
<p>Additionally, managers’ competitive worldview was positively
associated with the predicted impact of sending the dominant message on
their relationship with their employee; shown both with the expected
attitude operationalization of relationship expectancy (<em>b</em> =
.42, <em>t</em>(280) = 3.68, 95% CI = [0.20, 0.64], <em>p</em> &lt;
.001) and the expected nomination for the “good manager” survey (logit:
<em>b</em> = .63, <em>t</em>(280) = 4.08, 95% CI = [0.33, 0.94],
<em>p</em> &lt; .001).</p>

  <!-- LEFT: Text (30%) -->
  <div style="flex:0.3; min-width:260px;">

    <p>
      To test whether <strong>relationship expectancies</strong>, as opposed to <strong>compliance expectancies</strong>, explain why competitive worldview predicts dominant behavior, I conducted a set of bootstrapped simultaneous mediation analyses. Consistent with Studies 1 and 2, <strong>the indirect effect of relationship expectancy explained 23% of the total effect</strong> (b = 0.02, 95% CI = [0.01, 0.05], p = .027), whereas the indirect effect of compliance expectancy did not explain any of the total effect (b = -0.005, 95% CI = [-.02, 0.01], p = .539).

  </div>

</div>

<p>This result is particularly striking given the <strong>incentive
structure of the experiment</strong>. Although managers’ bonuses
depended entirely on employee compliance, and there was no ongoing
relationship or future interaction, <strong>relationship expectancies,
not compliance expectancies, explained dominant message choice</strong>.
Even when material outcomes were salient, managers’ beliefs about how
dominance would affect the relationship carried more weight than its
expected impact on performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="comparison-to-ground-truth" class="section level2">
<h2>Comparison to ground truth</h2>
<p>The second goal of Study 3 was to examine <strong>calibration
error</strong>: Are managers <strong>high</strong> in competitive
worldivew <strong>overly optimistic</strong> about the impact of
dominance on relationships OR are managers <strong>low</strong> in
competitive worldview <strong>overly pessimistic</strong> about the
impact of dominance on relationships OR both?</p>
<p>Phase 2 of the study, the employee phase, offered a ground truth
against which to compare managerial predictions. I compated managers’
predicted relationship outcomes to employees’ self-reported reactions,
using data from employees who received the dominant message (N = 150) as
ground truth.</p>
<p>Employees who received the dominant message:</p>
<ul>
<li>rated a mean relationship attitude of <strong>3.24</strong> (on a
7-point scale) towards their manager, and</li>
<li>nominated their manager for the “good manager”” survey at a rate of
<strong>48%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To do this, I compared managers’ predicted relationship outcomes to
employees’ self-reported reactions, using employees who received the
dominant message (N = 150) as ground truth.</p>
<p>A Johnson-Neyman interval analysis showed that managers <strong>low
in competitive worldview</strong> made predictions that were close to
employee outcomes, but managers <strong>high in competitive
worldview</strong> tended to <strong>overestimate</strong> how
positively employees would feel. In fact, the cutoff where predictions
began to diverge from reality occurred at 2 on the 1–7 competitive
worldview scale (<em>N</em> = 62). <strong>Above this point, managers
overestimated how positively employees would feel</strong>. Managers in
the middle of the competitive worldview distribution (−1 SD to +1 SD)
predicted less negative reactions (<em>M</em> = 3.69, <em>SD</em> =
1.56) than employees actually reported. Managers high in competitive
worldview (+1 SD and above) predicted that employees would feel
positively toward them (<em>M</em> = 4.72, <em>SD</em> = 1.71), placing
their expectations in roughly the <strong>88th–95th percentile of
employee-reported attitudes</strong>; far above the average employee
reaction to a dominant manager (<em>M</em> = 3.24).</p>
<p>I ran the same comparison for predicted nomination to a paid “good
manager” follow-up survey (actual nomination rate:
<strong>48%</strong>). Managers <strong>low in competitive
worldview</strong> (scores &lt; 2.80; N = 154)
<strong>underestimated</strong> nomination likelihood, predicting that
only 35.06% of employees would nominate them. Managers with
<strong>moderate competitive worldview</strong> (scores between 2.80 and
3.92; N = 114) were <strong>well calibrated</strong>, predicting a
nomination rate of 47.52%, nearly identical to observed outcomes.
Managers <strong>high in competitive worldview</strong> (scores &gt;
3.92; N = 28) <strong>overestimated</strong> nomination likelihood,
predicting that 64.29% of employees would nominate them.</p>
<p>In sum, across both operationalizations, managers <strong>high in
competitive worldview consistently overestimated the relational
consequences of sending the dominant message</strong>. The patterns for
managers with low and medium competitive worldview were mixed.</p>

<h2>Crowd-sourced dominance</h2>
<p>To <strong>rule out</strong> the possibility that the results of
Study 3 were driven by the specific messages I designed, I ran a
follow-up experiment using <strong>crowd-sourced dominant and
affiliative messages</strong> in the same incentive-compatible
manager–employee paradigm. Managers were randomly shown pairs of
<strong>naturalistic messages written by other participants and
validated by an independent sample</strong>. The core pattern
replicated: competitive worldview predicted selection of dominant
messages, competitive worldview predicted more positive relationship
expectancies for dominant communication, and relationship
expectancies—rather than compliance expectancies—again explained why
competitive worldview translated into dominant behavior.
<strong>Replicating the model with a large set of realistic,
participant-generated messages strengthens the external validity of
Study 3 and shows that the findings are not an artifact of

<h1>Study 4: Causal Impact of Relationship Expectancies</h1>
<p>While Studies 1–3 establish correlational and behavioral evidence
that relationship expectancies shape dominant leadership behavior,
<strong>Study 4 provides a direct causal test</strong>. Using the same
incentive-compatible paradigm from Study 3, I <strong>experimentally
shifted</strong> managers’ attention toward either the <strong>positive
or negative</strong> relationship consequences of dominant behavior
before they made a communication choice. Simply prompting managers to
reflect on relational impact—without changing incentives, compliance
expectations, or their underlying competitive worldview—substantially
altered behavior. <strong>Managers encouraged to think about positive
relationship consequences were nearly three times as likely to choose
the dominant message compared to those prompted to consider negative
consequences</strong>, and this effect was largely explained by changes
in relationship expectancies, not compliance expectancies. This
experiment closes the loop by showing that relationship expectancies are
not just predictive correlates of dominance, but a causal lever:
shifting how managers anticipate relational consequences directly
changes dominant behavior. A full A/B testing report detailing this
experiment is linked below.</p>

<h1>Implications for organizations</h1>
<p><strong>Dominant behavior often reflects a relational blind spot, not
bad intent.</strong></p>
<p>Across studies, managers who chose dominance were not trying to harm
relationships or ignoring them altogether. Instead, they systematically
<strong>mis-estimated the relational consequences</strong> of dominance;
creating <strong>unintended consequences</strong> and <strong>unforced
errors</strong> in managerial behavior.</p>
<p>This insight points to a set of <strong>low-cost, high-leverage
interventions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target the blind spot, not the person</strong></p>
<p>Interventions can focus on helping managers see the likely relational
fallout of dominance, rather than attempting to change their
motivations, personalities, or incentives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shift expectations at the moment of choice</strong></p>
<p>Brief prompts that surface relationship consequences, before a
message is sent or a decision is made, can meaningfully reduce dominant
behavior without removing authority or accountability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduce unforced relational errors</strong></p>
<p>By correcting expectancy errors, organizations can prevent avoidable
relationship damage that undermines trust, collaboration, and
psychological safety over time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improve outcomes without costly structural
change</strong></p>
<p>Because these interventions do not require redesigning incentives,
flattening hierarchies, or retraining managers from scratch, they are
scalable and inexpensive relative to their impact.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, reducing this relational blind spot should lead to
<strong>higher employee satisfaction, stronger manager–employee
collaboration, and better material outcomes</strong>. Importantly, this
does not necessitate making managers “nicer,” but helping them make more
accurate judgments about how their behavior lands with their
employees.</p>
